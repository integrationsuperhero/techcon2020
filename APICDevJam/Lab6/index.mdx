Your work as an Application Developer and API Designer is now complete.
It\'s time to switch roles and become an API Product Manager. The role
of the API Product Manager is to take the developed assets and bundle
them together using a go-to-market strategy.

 

In this case, you will publish the APIs from the accessories project
together as a bundled product offering to API Consumers. Additionally,
you will create two plans which have different levels of access to your
APIs.

In this tutorial, you will explore the following key capabilities:

-   Create a Product

-   Attach APIs to a Product

-   Create a Plan

-   Publish a Product

 APIC Dev Jam Series 
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

The APIC Dev Jam Series is a hands-on workshop with lab exercises that
walk you through designing, publishing, and securing APIs. This workshop
is for API developers, architects, and line of business people who want
to create a successful API strategy. There are 8 labs and each is 30
minutes long. Make sure you choose enough time in your reservation to
get through all the labs! 

 

[NOTE: ]**[This demo environment contains a
full API Connect installation in Cloud Pak for Integration. The login
information to the APIC cluster will be sent in a separate email when
you reserve the instance. Use Google Chrome, Firefox or Microsoft Edge
to access the cluster using the credentials supplied. Make sure you
login using API Manager User Registry not Common Services
