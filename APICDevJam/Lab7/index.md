**APIC Dev Jam - Lab 7 - The Consumer Experience**

In this lab, you will explore the consumer experience for APIs that have
been exposed to your Sandbox catalog. Using the Developer Portal, you
will log in and subscribe to the latest Accessories Product and test the
APIs from the portal, before testing it in a live Web Application.

In this tutorial, you will explore the following key capabilities:

-   Subscribe to a plan in order to consume an API.

-   Test an API from the developer portal.

-   Consume an API from a sample test application.

 APIC Dev Jam Series
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

The APIC Dev Jam Series is a hands-on workshop with lab exercises that
walk you through designing, publishing, and securing APIs. This workshop
is for API developers, architects, and line of business people who want
to create a successful API strategy. There are 8 labs and each is 30
minutes long. Make sure you choose enough time in your reservation to
get through all the labs! 

[NOTE: ]**[This demo environment contains a
full API Connect installation in Cloud Pak for Integration. The login
information to the APIC cluster will be sent in a separate email when
you reserve the instance. Use Google Chrome, Firefox or Microsoft Edge
to access the cluster using the credentials supplied. Make sure you
login using API Manager User Registry not Common Services
registry.]**

    time period. The Silver plan is limited to 100 requests per hour and
    does not require approval by the API provider for subscription
    requests.

11. A subscription wizard is initiated. All the applications available
    are displayed (in this case we only have the IBM Consumer
    application). Click [[Select
    App]] which
    is located below the application
    tile.

 Test APIs from the Developer Portal
============================================================================================================================

In this section, you will use the Developer Portal to test one of the
Accessories APIs. This is useful for application developers to try the
APIs before their application is fully developed or to simply see the
expected response based on inputs they provide the API.

1.  Click the [[logistics
    2.0.0]] API
    link on the Accessories product
    page.  
    ![](images/tutorial_html_8ec6b1024d5a2f9a.png)

2.  Click the [[GET
    /shipping]] path
    on the left navigation menu. 

3.  Click the \`Try it\` link to access the test
    area.  
    ![](images/tutorial_html_6326764a039cba2b.png)

4.  Scroll down to the Parameters section, enter any **United State Zip
    Code** (e.g., \`90210\`) and
    click [[Send]] to
    invoke the API.  
    ![](images/tutorial_html_74d26a44eab03d67.png)

5.  You should see a [[200
    OK ]]and
    a response body as shown
    below.  
    ![](images/tutorial_html_f9b90c1492df91e8.png)

6.  Go ahead and try out the [[Logistics GET
    /stores]] and
    the [[Financing GET
    /calculate ]]APIs
    as well.

 Summary
================================================================================================

Congratulations! You have created multiple plans, tested APIs in the
developer portal, and used the APIs in a consumer application.
