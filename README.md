# TechCon 2020 Labs

## Joining the labs
Proctored labs will be available August 11-13 from 11 AM EST to 4 PM EST. Labs will be first come first serve. Please check back each day during the labs as the links for our lab rooms will change. 

Please join the virtual lab room associated track that the lab is in. All passwords are the same: TechCon2020. Once in the room please ask one of the lab hosts for an access to an environment to work on the labs. We do request that you stay connected to our virtual room during the course of working on the lab so we can provide assistance. Please let a proctor know when you have completed your lab so we can free up the environment for other customers.

Spur innovations where a number of technologies are combined to create something new, for example, extending the ability apply for loan pre\-approvals that can be utilized within apps that search for cars or real estate\. To do this, you must first create the back\-end integrations, which combine data from existing core systems, disparate assets, or SaaS services with the ability to send critical data between systems reliably\. Second, you need to provide APIs to your back\-end integrations that secure access and apply rate limits\.\.                                                                                                        |

In this tutorial, we'll be taking a look at an example from the retail industry\. Starting with an existing API orchestrating the business function to "place an order"\. Let's say that when a customer places an order, we want to provide a real\-time response \-\- reward the customer with points in customer loyalty app or a gamification experience, or sign them up for a certain email nurture program\. To do that, we need each order to emit an event\. The Cloud Pak for Integration combines integration capabilities with Kafka based event streaming to make the data available for cloud\-native applications to subscribe to and use for a variety of business purposes\. |
