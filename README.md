We will begin by creating a new catalog and configuring the developer portal for our Inventory product\. We will then define a new plan in the product and publish to our new developer portal\.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

At this stage, however, the changes are still in draft mode\. In order for the changes to take effect, you must publish the APIs to the developer portal and make them available for the API Consumers\. Recall though that the inventory 1\.0\.0 version is already running and has active subscribers\.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Application Integration | Deploy an App integration and expose it securely as APIs                                                                           | Extending access via APIs to your back\-end integrations empower your partners and developer community to create new business value, technical value, and customer experiences for your products and offerings\. Spur innovations where a number of technologies are combined to create something new, for example, extending the ability apply for loan pre\-approvals that can be utilized within apps that search for cars or real estate\. To do this, you must first create the back\-end integrations, which combine data from existing core systems, disparate assets, or SaaS services with the ability to send critical data between systems reliably\. Second, you need to provide APIs to your back\-end integrations that secure access and apply rate limits\.\.                                                                                                        |
| Application Integration | Connect an App Integration with Message Queue using Cloud Pak for Integration                                                      | Modern applications and APIs all need the ability to communicate data reliably between mission critical systems across internal/external data sources, networks, and regions\. In mission critical environments your messaging infrastructure must be robust, reliable, and secure with the ability to integrate into your applications and APIs at pace and scale\. In this tutorial, you will create a message queue that will receive order data from an API call to a retail ordering system\. The red box in the diagram shows what you will be creating and where it fits in the overall architecture of a mobile retail buying application\.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Messaging & Events      | Connect IBM MQ with IBM Event Streams using the Kafka source connector                                                             | The most interesting and impactful new applications in an enterprise are the applications that provide new ways of interacting with existing systems by reacting in real\-time to mission\-critical data\. Leverage your existing investments, skills and even existing data, and use event\-driven techniques to offer more\-responsive and more\-personalized experiences\. IBM Event Streams has supported connectivity to the systems you’re already using\. By combining the capabilities of IBM Event Streams event streams and message queues, you can combine your transaction data with real\-time events to create applications and processes\.

| Messaging & Events      | Integrate Kafka with business Applications to create new responsive experiences                                                    | The most interesting and impactful new applications in an enterprise are those that provide interactive experiences by reacting to existing systems carrying out a business function\. In this tutorial, we'll be taking a look at an example from the retail industry\. Starting with an existing API orchestrating the business function to "place an order"\. Let's say that when a customer places an order, we want to provide a real\-time response \-\- reward the customer with points in customer loyalty app or a gamification experience, or sign them up for a certain email nurture program\. To do that, we need each order to emit an event\. The Cloud Pak for Integration combines integration capabilities with Kafka based event streaming to make the data available for cloud\-native applications to subscribe to and use for a variety of business purposes\. |
