# IEAM MMS Lab/Tutorial

# Introduction

IBM Edge Application Manager provides you with a new architecture for edge node management. It is designed specifically to minimize the risks that are inherent in the deployment of either a global or local fleet of edge nodes. You can also use IBM Edge Application Manager to manage the service software lifecycle on edge nodes fully autonomously.
Benefits of edge computing:
- Moving application workloads to edge nodes for supporting operations at remote locations where the data is collected instead of sending the data to the central data center for processing.
- With IBM Edge Application Manager, you can deploy and manage critical workloads on edge nodes securely and reliably to hundreds of remote locations from a central location, without requiring full-time IT staff to be deployed at each of the remote locations for managing the workloads onsite.

This repository is a lab/tutorial that demonstrates the [Open Horizon Model Management Service (MMS)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/models-deployed-at-the-edge).  

It was originally based on following documents:

[Hello MMS](https://github.com/open-horizon/examples/tree/master/edge/services/helloMMS#introduction)
